# Akka in Scala workshop

## Abstract
The objective of the workshop is to get some theoretical and practical overview of the actor model and asynchronous programming. You will learn how to program real applications using [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Throughout the day we will switch between quick introductions of the core features and longer step-by-step exercises.
