# Akka in Scala workshop

## Abstract
The objective of the workshop is to get some theoretical and practical overview of the actor model and asynchronous programming. You will learn how to program real applications using [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Throughout the day we will switch between quick introductions of the core features and longer step-by-step exercises.

## Table of Contents
  * Scala features
  * Actor model
  * Actors in Akka
  * Akka basics
  * Testing actors
  * Supervision strategy and fault tolerance
  * *(optionally)* [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) and microservices
  * *(optionally)* Overview of more advanced components and features  (persistence and remoting)

## Prerequisites
  * Familiarity with Scala syntax. See weeks 1 & 2 of [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun).
  * No prior Akka experience is required.

## Workshop details
 
We are going to implement "Hot Or Not Movie" game which is a comparison-based rating system..
 
### Scala features
  * Java `List` vs Scala `List`
  * Immutable collections
  * `Option`
  * Exceptions vs `Try`
